			<!-- paragraph class established, -->
			<p class="paragraph">
				The Blue Orchid was one of the multitude of flowers introduced in 1.7. Like most other flowers, it can be crafted into a Dye, in this case Light Blue Dye. It is also unique in that it cannot be found in forests, plains, or, most surprisingly, flower forests, like the normal flowers. The Blue Orchid can only be found in Swamp Biomes or Snowless Taiga Biomes. These make it more rare than, say, Poppies or Dandelions.
